# Introduction

The new debug bar for Laravel is a free, open-source, modern, and beautiful tool created to help Laravel developers.

The tool was created by [Benjamin Crozat](https://x.com/benjamincrozat) and is actively [looking for funding](https://github.com/sponsors/benjamincrozat) for its development.

**To this day, access to its repository is restricted to its sponsors and this documentation is a work in progress.**
